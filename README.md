Email Verification Tool
This is a simple Python script that verifies the validity of a list of email addresses. It uses DNS to find the mail server of each email address, and then attempts to connect to each mail server to verify the email address.

Getting Started
To use this tool, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/verify-email.git](https://github.com/toolscrackedx/Verify-Email-By-Content-Random.git)
Navigate to the project directory using cd verify-email
Create a file called emails.txt and add a list of email addresses you want to verify (one email per line)
Run the script using the command python verify_email.py emails.txt verified_emails.txt, where emails.txt is the name of your input file and verified_emails.txt is the name of the output file where the verified emails will be written.
Wait for the script to finish. The verified emails will be written to the output file.

Download the verify_email.py script and save it to your computer.

1- Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where the verify_email.py file is located.

2- Run the command python verify_email.py [input_file] [output_file], where [input_file] is the path to the file containing the email addresses to be verified and [output_file] is the path to the file where the results will be written.

3- Wait for the verification process to complete. The tool will display a message for each email address indicating whether it is valid or invalid.

Once the verification process is complete, check the output file to see which email addresses were verified successfully.
