Email Verification Tool
This is a simple Python script that verifies the validity of a list of email addresses. It uses DNS to find the mail server of each email address, and then attempts to connect to each mail server to verify the email address.

Getting Started
To use this tool, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/yourusername/verify-email.git
Navigate to the project directory using cd verify-email
Create a file called emails.txt and add a list of email addresses you want to verify (one email per line)
Run the script using the command python verify_email.py emails.txt verified_emails.txt, where emails.txt is the name of your input file and verified_emails.txt is the name of the output file where the verified emails will be written.
Wait for the script to finish. The verified emails will be written to the output file.
